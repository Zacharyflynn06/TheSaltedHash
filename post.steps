This week, our chefs introduced our two favorite (aforementioned) foods, creating a mash-up for the ages. To do it, they swapped traditional beef for pork, glazed the patties with umami-packed hoisin, and topped them with a tangy cucumber-carrot slaw and sriracha mayo. Everything is sandwiched between squishy potato buns for a burger so delicious, you may find yourself with a new BFF (best food friend, that is).[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;35m\r[0m[31m[1;35m\n[0m[31m[1;31m"[0m[31m[0m,
